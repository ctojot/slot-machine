# Slot Machine Project

```text
It has been a long time since I've touched JavaScript, so I decided to put what I learned from my coding bootcamp (Code Fellows) to the test. Searched up a simple JavaScript project on youtube and decided to start there. I ended up choosing 'Learn JavaScript With This One Proejct' from Tech With Tim. Very easy to do and follow project in my opinion.

The video was structed as follows:

- Talked about what the project was going to be
- Showed a whiteboard drawing of project
- Mapped out what the key features of the slot machine were and explained what needed to be done
- Start building the project, while also informing the viewers about what he's doing and why he's doing it
- As we're building each component out, he also tests to make sure that each component works the way it's intended

I have a simple goal with the project;
- Refresh myself on JavaScript
- Build out the whole project line by line following the video
- Add some of my own personal touches
- Continue to add additonal features and possibly get an front end interface out for the whole project (since the whole idea of it was backend focused)

One thing I don't want to do is overload myself and try to do this all in one go. One of the biggest things that stressed me about about the whole software developer path in a coding boot camp is that I felt like I had very little time to actually learn. Since I'm out of it with a better foundation and understanding of coding, I plan on taking it easy, actually learning about what's going on and fully master JavaScript at my own pace.

Today was just a very simple day for project. I watched the video and followed along with building the whole thing out. Some of things he talked about were very familiar to me (Thank you Code Fellows), but there were also thing that he did that I actually had to Google and ask 'Why he do that?'

Long story short, the whole project is built out code for code. Which is very great. Took longer than I thought especially after looking at all the code. I also didn't realize that it was a backend focused application till I was already too deep in. Oh well. Any who, I think right here is a good place to stop. The app works the way it was intended. On top of not touching JavaScript, I also had to revist github which was again, something I haven't done in so long that I struggle to even figure out how to make a repo for an existing project. I ended up setting up a brand new repo, cloning that one down, and just copying and pasting what I had and push it up. Felt really good about this part, felt like I unlocked a core memory here. 

I also wanted to add that after looking at all the repo's on my github are super janky, I decided I wanted to keep notes in here, almost like a diary of what I've been doing, not just for any viewers, but manly for myself. 

Anyways, my goal for next time is give the app some touch ups. Change up some of the code to fit the way I learned how to code like with naming conventions and other thigns, I also want to see if I can basically turn this into a website. It sounds very time consuming, but I'll have to see what I can do the next time.
